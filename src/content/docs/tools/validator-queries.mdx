The following queries can be performed using the scripts in the `tools` directory.

## Estimate Withdrawal Sweep
Estimate the next/previous automatic withdrawal "sweeps" of any validator.  Any validator index or pubkey
can be used, even if it is not yet a **0x01** type validator.
As such, it is useful when [timing validator conversions](../../guides/compound-or-consolidate/#1-time-the-conversion-carefully).

```
Usage:
  estimate-withdrawal-sweep.sh [options] validator1 [validator2 ...]
Options:
  --no-banner   Do not show banner
  --help, -h    Show this message
```

#### Example
```bash
cd ethereum-node
./tools/estimate-withdrawal-sweep.sh 93587 329469
```
```
Target validator: 93587
Approx. time since last withdrawal: -21:35:39
Approx. time until next withdrawal: 23:15:26

Target validator: 329469
Approx. time since last withdrawal: -21:35:38
Approx. time until next withdrawal: 23:15:27
```


## Estimate Block Proposal Frequency
Calculate the expected average block proposal frequency.

```
Usage:
  estimate-bp-frequency.sh [options] validator1 [validator2 ...]
Options:
  --no-banner   Do not show banner
  --help, -h    Show this message
```

#### Example
```bash
cd ethereum-node
./tools/estimate-bp-frequency.sh 329469 1150854
```
```
Validator: 329469
Average time between block proposals: 174.2 days

Validator: 1150854
Average time between block proposals: 2.7 days
```
